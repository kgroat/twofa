# Contributing to twofa

It's great that you want to contribute. Thanks for that, you rock 🤘

Since this is a small project, there are no real guidelines. If you open a good-quality pull request, it will very likely be accepted.

Just please keep in mind the overarching "north star" of the project - to stay simple, and do one thing well.

While any contributions are encouraged (including spelling mistakes), here are some ideas for contributing that would be especially useful:

- 🐞 bug fixes (obviously)
- 🛠 ability to have more fine-grained configuration (e.g. use different access levels per-account etc.)
- 🐧 cross-platform support
- 💯 tests 

Thanks again!
